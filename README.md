This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to the interaction between instance variable accessors and direct instance variable manipulation. The bug arises from the fact that modifying an instance variable directly using `instance_variable_set` does not always immediately update the value returned by methods that indirectly access the variable. The `bug.rb` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.rb` offers a potential solution.
